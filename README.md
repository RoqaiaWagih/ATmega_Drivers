# ATmega_Drivers
This is an ATmega Drivers for the NTI Automotive Embedded Systems Internship. This project was written in C using Microchip Studio and Proteus 8 Professional.

## Demonstration

I used Proteus 8 Professional and Eta32 ATMEL AVR Development Kit in order to simulate AVR Atmega32. 

## System Functionality
- DIO DRIVER
- LCD DRIVER
- SEVEN SEGMENT DRIVER
